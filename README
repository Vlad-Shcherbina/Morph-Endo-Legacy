This whole dir is eclipse pydev project.



Layout:

    sources, apparently
    and some packages
    General idea is that every python script that is supposed to be run with
    command line arguments should be in 'src' folder (so that it won't cause
    problems with PYTHONPATH when run from command line). Scripts that are
    run withoud command like arguments and thus can be conveniently run from
    eclipse, are allowed in package folders as well (because eclipse adds src
    to python path).
