Weird RNA represents procedures enter and exit.

For instance, rna mentioned on the plate (rna_code.return_rna) is return.
Some other recognized rna are listed in rna_code.weird_rna.


Guide to enrich this dictionary (actually, I don't know whether it's really
needed, and it's labour-intensive):

 * Run rna_code.py --weird --unknown <rna file> >calltree
 * Observe resulting call tree. 
 * Find some mysterious unrecognized rna.
 * Set it as breakpoint in build.py (currently via source modification)
(this breakpoint will be activated on _exit_ from corresponding procedure)
 * Run build.py <rna file>
 * Wait until breakpoint is reached. 
 * Observe what was drawn as a result of this enigmatic procedure 
in _breakpoint.png
 * add it to rna_code.weird_rna dictionary
