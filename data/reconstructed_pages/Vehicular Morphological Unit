Vehicular Morphological Unit

FuunTech Inc.'s Vehicular Morphological Unit (VMU) leverages 
advanced patented technology to allow space travellers to blend in 
with even the most primitive worlds, while retaining optimal mobility. 
When activated, the VMU scans the current planetary environment 
and morphs the customer's space ship into an inconspicuous vehicle 
guaranteed not to draw attention from the natives.

Note that due to a number of class-action lawsuits, FuunTech has 
decided to discontinue an earlier product, the Biomorphological Unit 
(BMU). FuunTech Management wishes to emphasise that under 
normal operating conditions, it is not possible for customers to be 
morphed into hideously disfigured mutants. However, use of the 
BMU on deployed Fuun models is strictly at one's own risk.

The VMU ships as an optional DNA module. To activate it, a 
registration code must be entered. If you do not have a registration 
code at present, please contact the FuunTech Customer Service 

Department on Rigel IV.
