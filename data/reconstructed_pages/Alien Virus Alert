Alien Virus Alert

Recent research          
has shown that 
alien viruses may 
negatively 
influence Fuun 
DNA. FuunTech Inc. 
is working on a 
generic anti-virus 
facility remedy 


this problem for 
            
traveling Fuuns.

As a work-around, 
FuunTech Inc. 
offers vaccination 
DNA patches for a 

range of popular 
galactic 
destinations. 

Fuuns that plan on 
traveling outside 
the Fuunian Union 
should purchase 
one. Failure to do 
so will result in 
a voided warranty. 

Have a nice trip!
